        <h1>William Butler Yeats</h1>
        <h2><em>"Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven"</em></h2>
        <p>Had I the heavenâ€™s embroidered cloths,</p>
<p>with golden and silver light,</p>
<p>blue and the dim and the dark cloths</p>
<p>Of night and light and the half-light,</p>
<p>I would spread the cloths under your feet:</p>
<p>But I, being poor, have only my dreams;</p>
<p>I have spread my dreams under your feet;</p>
<p>Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</p>
